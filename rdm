Step 1.

dos2unix <files_name>

If scripts are downloaded, extract and rename the zip file to "appdynamics-machine-agent-installation" 

Step 2.
Example command for copying file to a target host

# Starting on a local machine, within a folder containing the appdynamics-machine-agent-installation/ folder from git

# Run the following with your own user account [user] that has access to the bastion server and target host

  $ scp -r appdynamics-machine-agent-installation/ [user]@[bastion-ip]:/tmp

  $ ssh [user]@[bastion-ip]

  $ scp -r /tmp/appdynamics-machine-agent-installation/ [hostname]:/tmp

  $ ssh [hostname]

  $ dzdo su - appdmon

  $ cp -r /tmp/appdynamics-machine-agent-installation/ /home/appdmon

  $ cd /home/appdmon/appdynamics-machine-agent-installation/

  

Check the file permissions on the folder and scripts

 Owner: appdmon

 Group: appdmongrp

  Mode: 755

Step 3.
Make sure all the values are correct and are placed under the correct controller.

Examples of PLTE configurations can be found in the description

Checks the to destination directories have to be conducted.

## PRE INSTALL SCRIPTS ## 

Check that ' /opt/appd ' is owned by ' appdmon '

and that 

Check that ' /opt/appd/machineagent '  is owned by ' appdmon ' and is in the group  ' appdmongrp'

Step 4.

Run the installation script, with the relevant option.

 









# Check the contents of the configuration files

# As the ' appdmon ' user run the following 

  

$ ./configure_machineagent.sh

  

# Follow the on screen instructions
 

INSTALLATION [FOR ADMIN]

In order to add the machine agent as a service the daemonse_me.sh script will need to be ran.

 









AS ROOT

$ cd /home/appdmon/appdynamics-machine-agent-installation/

$ ./daemonize_me.sh

  

Once the the service has been added to the in scripts, the following commands can be used to interact with the agent:

  

$ service machineagent start 

 

$ service machineagent stop

$ service machineagent status
